### Hi there 👋

Here are some ideas to get you started:

🔭 I’m currently working as a Software/ML engineer at Camcloud. Our product helps people and organizations to easily stream their security cameras to cloud, so they can monitor it through a browser or mobile app. We also do some machine learning tasks on those streams so they can gain some insights, motion detection, object detection, or 24/7 analysis. These types of stuff. Our main challenge is scale it up without ending up with crazy AWS bills.  
A few facts about me:
💬 I care about science, society, and philosophy.
😌 I'm terrible at small talk. 
🏃 I love playing soccer, volleyball, table tennis, swimming, and cycling. On the other hand, you'll never see me playing basketball or running. I hate them for some reason. 
🚀 I also enjoy playing CoD (only Modern Warfare series lol) and FIFA.
